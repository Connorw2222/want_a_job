## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

Want a job? is a powerful application for employers to use to find new new candidates for different job positions. Candidates go through a simple 3 step process to apply, candidates also do not need to signup for an account but they do have the option to do so if they choose. 

1. Search for their desired job
2. Upload the resume to the job list
3. and press the Apply button! Simple!

We also created features for our premium members(employers) as well. To post a job listing, they must first signup for an account with the prefered payment plan selected. They will have access to free trial to give the application a chance prior to making the final decision.
